##### Full Stack Web Developer 🧑‍💻 & Video Editor 🎬
I recently graduated from [Universitas Negeri Surabaya](https://unesa.ac.id/) with a Bachelor’s degree in Informatics Engineering, gaining experience through both internships and individual projects. I enjoy developing programs that focus on user-friendliness and designing minimalistic yet highly functional interfaces. Beyond programming, I also pursue video editing as a hobby and a creative routine in my spare time.
